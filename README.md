# alce-docker-vnc
Astra Linux Common Edition 2.12 with Fly desktop Environment as a docker container, spiced up with bugs and depression. I don't know any reason why someone would need this.

Use privileged mode. Don't forget to publish ports (i do sometimes).

Example: docker run -p 25565:5900 --privileged dashusky/alce-docker-vnc:Dockerfile
